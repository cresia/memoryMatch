## Getting Started

After navigating into this repository, you will want to start by creating a new branch off of the `master` branch to contain the code required for the next feature of this project.

### Before each feature

- Make sure that the current branch says `master`.
  - Check that with the `git status` command.
    1. If you are on `master`:
       - `git pull origin master`, will get your most up to date changes and update this branch.
       - `git checkout -b FEATURE_NAME_HERE`, will create a new branch based on the name provided to represent this next feature.
    2. If not, `git checkout master`, will take you back to the default branch.
       - Go back to step 1.
    3. If you're not sure how, contact an instructor.
- **Example**
  - `git status`
  - `git checkout master`
  - `git pull origin master`
  - `git checkout -b skeleton`
